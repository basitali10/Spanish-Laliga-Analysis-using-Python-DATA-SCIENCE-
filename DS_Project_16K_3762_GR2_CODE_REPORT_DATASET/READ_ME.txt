Instructions Regarding Running Project :

1) Copy the the Spanish_League_Dataset.csv file present in folder "Dataset" in the directory in which you will run the project. 

If step 1 is not properly executed there is a chance that program will not function properly and unable to read the .csv file.

2)Open the (DS_Project_Code_16K_3762_GR2.ipynb) file in Jupyter Notebook 
  OR 
  Copy the complete code present in (DS_Project_Code_16K_3762_GR2.txt) in your IDE.
 
3)Now run the Program. 

4)Program will take relatively more time around (2-3) minutes because it is exporting each and every result in the form of .csv and .png files for better understadning of results.

Optional: If You don't want to execute a Program to save time then I have also upload my project output on Google drive (  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HwirWejWSvS9nxuZOa7zjeFOrz2-Px3b?usp=sharing  ) . It can also be downloaded from google drive.

5) Once the program have been executed the prompt is shown on the console "Program ended Gracefully."

6) Now the new Folder named "DS_Project_Output_16K_3762_GR2" will be created in your working directory which contains all the required results and findings.

NOTE: I have not shown the complete understanding of (DS_Project_Output_16K_3762_GR2) in Project Report because there are so many .csv and .png files. So in order for better understanding Please Have a look in the Folder named "DS_Project_Output_16K_3762_GR2".

Thank you.
